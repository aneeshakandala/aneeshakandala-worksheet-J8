## 1. What is the difference between a functional and non-functional requirement?
  Functional requirements are used to define what a system is supposed to do, and then non functional requirements are supposd to specify constraints about how to system should operate. 
  
## 2. Give two example functional requirements for Instagram.com.
Two examples of functional requirements could be the ability to like and comment on posts, and the ability to follow other people on instagram. 

## 3. Give two example non-functional requirements for Instagram.com.
An example of a non-functional requirement would be a usability requirement, like making sure a font is large enough to be seen by all instagram users. Another example is the layout of instagram, such as if the pictures and set ups of the widgets in Instagram go together well. 

## 4. Draw a use case diagram for Instagram.com with at least three uses cases shown, where at least one use case extends another, and there are two actors.

## 5. Why has software engineering evolved to often embrace agile development models over waterfall ones?
Agile methods are simply more useful because, unlike the waterfall approach, only small pieces of the system are fully fleshed out at a time with protoypes that allow for client feedback. This is benefitial at reducing the number of changes that must be incorporated later. 

## 6. Draw a diagram where there are at least two interconnected paths: a critical path, and at least one non-critical path.
